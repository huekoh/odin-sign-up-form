In this project, I use HTML and CSS to create a simple sign up form webpage that includes a side image, and a content section comprising of headers, a form with its necessary fields and a button.

Simple validation is used for the form fields in HTML, and I explore using pseudo classes in CSS to provide more feedback from the page to the users.
